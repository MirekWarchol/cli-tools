This should solve the problem

git config core.quotepath false

From man git-config(1) for core.quotepath:

    The commands that output paths (e.g. ls-files, diff), when not given the -z option, will quote “unusual” characters in the pathname by enclosing the pathname in a double-quote pair and with backslashes the same way strings in C source code are quoted. If this variable is set to false, the bytes higher than 0×80 are not quoted but output as verbatim. Note that double quote, backslash and control characters are always quoted without -z regardless of the setting of this variable.
