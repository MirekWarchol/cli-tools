helpmessage="This script will build LilyPond for you.

You should have a git repository with LilyPond source code,
and an environment variable \$LILYPOND_GIT pointing there.

Usage: with no options specified, lilypond will be built in
\$LILYPOND_BUILD_DIR/current, using the current state of the
working directory in \$LILYPOND_GIT repository.

-s option means to \"build from scratch\", i.e. delete previous
   build results before compiling again.

-b option tells make just to compile C++ files, without walking
   through all other files.  If this is all you need, it is the
   fastest solution.

-t <value> sets the amount of time for which the script is paused
   when the user has to check whether the setup is correct.

-h displays this help.

-c <commit> tells the script to compile a particular commit
   instead of current working directory state. This can be
   a SHA1 commit ID, branch name or a tag name. This value
   will also be used as the name of the build subdirectory,
   unless overridden with a -d option.

-d <path> is the directory where the build will happen.
   This can be an absolute path or a path relative to
   \$LILYPOND_BUILD_DIR.

-l build in the current directory.

-r compile regression tests.

-f <path> take sources from this directory, not \$LILYPOND_GIT.

Sometimes it is useful to have multiple LilyPond builds,
or to be able to continue changing source code while the
previous state is being compiled.  You can do this quite
easily - set your \$LILYPOND_BUILD_DIR to a directory outside
of \$LILYPOND_GIT, and compile lilypond in its subdirectories
(using the -d option of this script).

In such situations (i.e. when the build directory isn't inside
main repository) the script will clone lilypond repository into
that build directory, so that it will be completely separate
from your main repository.  This way you can continue your work,
switch branches etc. without affecting the code that is being
compiled at the moment.

Note that these \"satellite build repositories\" work just as
\"regular builds\" inside \$LILYPOND_GIT - you don't have to
commit your work to build it, and if you make changes, you can
rebuild them in the same satellite repo without having to copy
things around or rebuilding from scratch.  The script handles
all this quite fine.

This script can be called from any directory whatsoever.

Example usage:
path-to-this-script -d mybuildname -c master
will compile master branch in \$LILYPOND_BUILD_DIR/mybuildname
