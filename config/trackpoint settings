Run the following commands in a gnome-terminal:

echo 255 | sudo tee /sys/devices/platform/i8042/serio1/serio2/sensitivity

echo 255 | sudo tee /sys/devices/platform/i8042/serio1/serio2/speed

echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/devices/platform/i8042/serio1/serio2/press_to_select





Create a new udev rule

Now we need to apply the settings during the system start. Therefore, press Alt + F2, type gksu gedit /etc/udev/rules.d/trackpoint.rules, and hit Enter (this will ask you for your password). Then paste the following, save, and reboot:
S
SUBSYSTEM=="serio", DRIVERS=="psmouse", WAIT_FOR="/sys/devices/platform/i8042/serio1/serio2/sensitivity", ATTR{sensitivity}="220", ATTR{speed}="110"






I finally found a working solution:

1. Find the device path of your trackpoint

Run the following in a gnome-terminal (can be opened with Ctrl+Alt+t):

find /sys/devices/platform/i8042 -name name | xargs grep -Fl TrackPoint | sed 's/\/input\/input[0-9]*\/name$//'

It will return something like

/sys/devices/platform/i8042/serio1/serio2

change to whatever it returns for you in the following step.

2. Create a new upstart-job

Still in the terminal type:

sudo gedit /etc/init/trackpoint.conf

A text editor will pop up. Paste the following code in it:

description "Trackpoint-Settings"
env TPDIR=/sys/devices/platform/i8042/serio1/serio2
start on virtual-filesystems
script
  while [ ! -f $TPDIR/sensitivity ]; do
        sleep 2
  done
  echo -n 200 > $TPDIR/sensitivity
  echo -n 150 > $TPDIR/speed
  echo -n 1 > $TPDIR/press_to_select
end script

Don' forget to edit the second line if needed (see step 1).

You can edit the numbers in line eight and nine (representing sensitivity and speed) to whatever you prefer. Both can be set in a range from 0 to 255. Leaving them at 200 and 150 works good for me.

Save and exit.

That's it.
